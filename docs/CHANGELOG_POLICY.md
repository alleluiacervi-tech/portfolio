# Changelog Policy

## Purpose

Maintain concise, high-signal release notes for each production change.

## Entry Rules

For every shipped change, include:

- What changed
- Why it changed
- Impact (user-facing, internal, or infrastructure)

## Categories

- Added
- Changed
- Fixed
- Security
- Maintenance

## Writing Guidelines

- Keep entries specific and actionable.
- Avoid vague notes like "minor updates".
- Reference issue/PR IDs when available.

## Exclusions

Routine dependency bumps may be grouped unless they carry user-facing impact.
